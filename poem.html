             <i><h3>Poem By Robert Frost</i></h3> 
                <br>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</br>
                   <br>And sorry I could not travel both</br>
                   <br>And be one traveler, long I stood</br>
                   <br>And looked down one as far as I could</br>
                  <br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</br>
                  <br>Then took the other, as just as fair,</br>
                  <br>And having perhaps the better claim,</br>
                 <br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</br>
                 <br>Though as for that the passing there</br>
                 <br>Had worn them really about the same,</br>
                 <br>And both that morning equally lay</br>
                 <br>In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                 <br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</br>
                <br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</br>
                <br>I doubted if I should ever come back.</br>
                <br>I shall be telling this with a sigh</br>
                <br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</br>
                <br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</br>
                <br>I took the one less traveled by,</br>
                <br>And that has made all the difference.</br>
